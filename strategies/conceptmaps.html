<h1><span class="strategy-title">Concept Maps</span></h1>


<h3> <span class="step-word">Step 1</span> Decide what concept you will explore and write it in a big circle the center of a piece of paper</h3>
	<p>Think about what main idea, philosophy, theme, or concept your next test or quiz is over. If you struggle to come up with a topic, it may be helpful to look at the name of the chapter or unit your class is studying. Instructors will often organize their syllabi into units, so looking at the syllabus may also help to decide what concepts to map. Asking the instructor for specifics about an upcoming exam is an easy way to know what will be on upcoming tests and quizzes.</p>
	<p>Add the main concept to the map as a large circle in the middle of the paper. These circles are known as nodes</p>

<h3><span class="step-word">Step 2</span> Brainstorm significant details, ideas, definitions, information, and personal connections to the main concept and add them as nodes around the central circle</h3>
	<p>Adding related concepts and details as nodes to your map shows what connections you can make from the main concept to other ideas discussed in class. 
    	<p><div class="meta-que">
         <img src="imgs/Icons/meta-que-icon.svg"
         width= "7%"
         height="auto"/>Ask yourself:
         <ul>
       <li> What have I read in the textbook about the main topic? </li>
       <li> What has the instructor said in class about the main topic?</li>
       <li>  What first comes to mind when I think about the main topic?</li>
       <li> What topics are listed on the syllabus about the main topic?</li>
       </ul></div></p>
	List the main ideas around the central topic and circle them. There is no limit to how many nodes you can add. Add as many as you can without making the space too crowded. Nodes can have one word or be short phrases or sentences. Try to keep them as short as possible.</p>
	<p>In the example below, the “Articles,” “Founding Fathers,” “Amendments,” and “Branches of government” nodes have been added to the map. These ideas were important concepts mentioned by the instructor in lecture and discussed in the textbook at length.</p>

<h3><span class="step-word">Step 3</span> Connect the nodes with arrows and a short phrase that relates the two ideas</h3>
	<p>Using arrows are useful and help express how the concepts are related. Arrows show the flow of your thoughts and help you read the concept map when you review it.<p>
	<p>Adding a short phrase or word to the connecting arrows helps put into words how the concepts are connected, aiding memory and recall. Creating these connections require critical thinking, which results in a deeper learning of the information. These connections should make sense to you and show your understanding of the concepts. The phrases can be anything that expresses the relationships between the concepts, but should also be as short as possible.</p>
	<p>Connections can be made between any nodes in your map. The more connections you can make, the more deeply you will process. learn, and remember the information.</p>

   </div>


<h3><span class="step-word">Step 4</span> Expand on the significant details and ideas surrounding the main concept</h3>
	<p>As in step 2, brainstorm ideas, details, and information about the nodes you have added to your map. Remember to think about what your instructor and textbook have mentioned about the concepts in your map. Connect the new nodes with arrows and a short phrase or word as in step 3.</p>
	<p>Repeat this step until you have added all the information you can recall about the nodes you have added to your map. Add as many nodes as necessary, but try to keep the map for becoming too crowded.</p>
	<p>In the example below, 3 nodes were added to the “Article” node and connected as “Examples” because they are example of Articles found in the Constitution. 3 new nodes were also added to the “Amendments” node. A node defining the term “Amendment” was added to the map and connected by the term “Definition.” A node explaining the process of creating an Amendment was added and connected by the term “Process.” The other nodes added to the concept map are similarly connected by phrases and arrows that show the nature of the relationship between the concepts.</p>

<h3><span class="step-word">Step 5</span> Look for concepts that you need to study more</h3>
    <p>Concept maps show you what you know about a concept, and what you don’t know. Nodes that do not have many connections show what concepts you need to review and study. Look for the concepts on your map that lack connections and add more links to your map so that all nodes have a few connections. This may require reviewing your textbook or notes to find more information.</p>
 	<p>Some important concepts may be missing from your map as well. Reflect on what you have learned in class about the information in your map. Is there an important concept that the instructor or textbook has mentioned that is missing? If so, review your notes and textbook and add it to the map.</p>
    <p><div class="meta-que">
         <img src="imgs/Icons/meta-que-icon.svg"
         width= "7%"
         height="auto"/>Ask yourself:
        <ul>
           <li>Could I teach all the concepts on my map to a friend?</li>
           <li>Are there any topics missing from my map?</li>
           <li>What nodes do not have many connections?</li>
           <li>Did I struggle to create connections to a topic?</li>
        </ul></div></p>
   
    <p>In the example above, the “Founding Fathers” node did not have very many connections in the concept map, showing that it was a concept that needed further review and study. After looking over notes and the textbook, information was added to the map below. “James Madison” is connected to the “Founding fathers” node by the term “Author” because he was the main author of the Constitution and the “Articles of Confederation failed” node is connected to the “Founding Fathers” node by the term “reason” because that is the reason the Founding Fathers created the Constitution.</p>

<h3><span class="step-word">Step 6</span> Frequently review your concept map until you can teach it without looking at it. The more you review your notes, the better you will remember.</h3>
    <p>Spacing out your study is key in helping you remember and retain information. Every day, or a few times a week, review your concept map by looking it over. Better yet, try to recreate your concept map by drawing it from memory. Repeat this process until you can easily explain all the concepts and connections on your concept map.</p>
      <p>Ask yourself:
        <ul>
           <li>Could I teach all the concepts on my map to the class?</li>
           <li> What questions would they ask about my concept map?</li>
        </ul>
      By thinking about what questions the students in your class would ask you, you are preparing yourself for the questions you will see on your test. Review your map, notes, and textbook until you feel you could teach the concepts on your map and answer all the questions students would ask.</p>
